# Homework before training

1. Run `/init` inside Claude Code in your repo.

2. Improve context in key areas

  ```text
  Gather more context about AREA. Summarize it for me and then update our @CLAUDE.md file.
  ```

3. Cleanup the file for human readability.

```text
Cleanup our @CLAUDE.md file to use the following six headers. Keep the content clear, but concise.
## Overview
## Architecture & Patterns
## Stack Best Practices
## Anti-Patterns
## Data Models
## Configuration, Security, and Authentication
```

4. Copy the `.claude/commands` directory into your repo. Customize at least one command for your codebase.

5. Push your CLAUDE.md file & slash commands to your repo.
